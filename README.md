## What is Stellite?
Stellite is the world's first Fortnite Festival autoplayer, with high customizability and a useful featureset.

You can [see it in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ho50fxCqPs)

## Limitations
- Stellite can only play well on the drums
- Stellite only hits double tap notes (the diamonds) by random chance and may miss notes that are too far out. This is a problem on 1-3 songs, but your chances can be greatly increased by setting your ingame settings to the recommended ones.
- Stellite universally supports 16:9 resolutions, but higher resolutions than 1440 require additional support due to the lack of match images. Contact me for further assistance or make your own according to the naming scheme in the assets folder

## Benefits
### Performance benefits:
- Stellite can play any song flawlessly on any difficulty, including expert.
- Stellite can achieve high rankings worldwide, depending on the presence of exploited scores for that song.
- Stellite is COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE.

### Account benefits:
- Gain free Season Levels for the battle pass via the Try Fortnite Festival quest line.
- Earn Festival Points and claim free rewards through various quest lines.

## Usage
- Use Python 3.10.6
- Play Fortnite on windowed fullscreen, and preferably low quality rendering mode (this makes brightness match with what the match images use)
- Set your Fortnite Festival keybinds to D, F, J, K, L (the default two hands A preset)
- Use the setup.bat file to install dependencies
- Run the start.bat script or bot.py directly
- Restart the program after altering the config file, if needed
- Join the discord for the config values explanation

## IMPORTANT NOTES
Currently the only built in match images are for 1440p, 1080p, and 768p, if you have a different resolution you must either make your own images matching those in the assets folder with those that suite your game or contact me on the discord to do it for you, and help me add support to mose resolutions

To play songs flawlessly you will most likely have to fine-tune the configuration values to achieve optimal results based on your resolution, processing speed, and refresh rate, especially if your resolution is something other than 1080p. Use the debug window for assistance.

## Why is Stellite closed source?
Stellite is psuedo closed source to protect against theft and unauthorized distribution, and you can always run it through VirusTotal. I may publish the source some time in the future, but If you have questions regarding how the program works or want me to help you make your own for another platform, I'd love to! feel free to contact me in the server
