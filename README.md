## `What is Stellite?`
### Stellite is the world's ~~worst~~ first Fortnite Festival autoplayer, with high customizability and precision

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/0-percent-optimized.svg)]([https://forthebadge.com](https://discord.gg/bkWf3AqrEY)) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/ctrl-c-ctrl-v.svg)](https://discord.gg/bkWf3AqrEY)

## `What are the limitations?`
- Stellite cannot play click and drag notes, MEANING STELLITE CAN ONLY PLAY WELL ON THE DRUMS!
- Stellite only hits perfect notes by random chance, it does not do it on purpose, and if perfect note diamonds are too far out from a note they will not be hit and ruin the bots streak and score (luckily this only happens on about 1-3 songs)
- Stellite universally supports 16:9 resolutions, however if you have a resolution higher then 1080p there are no supported match pictures included, and as such you must contact me for help adding support

## `With that in mind, what are the benefits?`
### Perfomance benefits:
- Stellite will play any song on any difficulty, including expert, do it flawlessly and and will get the extra orange stars
- Stellite will place top 500 to top 10000 worldwide depending on how many exploited/hacked scores there are in your songs leaderboard (you will often be 40k score below the top 10 players, even having played the song perfectly)
- Stellite is completely undetectable, not much epic can do other then block the win32 api anyway

### Account benefits:
- Gain massive amounts of free Season Levels for the battle pass via the Try Fortnite Festival quest line!
- Get massive amounts of Festival Points via the Jam and Main Stage: Daily, Weekly, and Milestone quest lines and claim your free rewards!

## `IMPORTANT:`
With the customization comes tuning. In order to achieve the above results you MAY have to fine tune some of the values in the configuration file in order to achieve those results, depending on your resolution, processing speed, and refresh rate. The default config out of the box comes with the config which nets me the above results on my fast pc outputting on a 144hz 1080p display. The good news is, Stellite has a toggleable debug window which will help you easily tune your settings to match my best performance!

## `Why is Stellite closed source?`
I'd rather build my own community then have someone steal it and take credit, or even charge for it. You can always run it through VirusTotal. If you have questions regarding how the program works or want me to help you make your own for another platform, feel free to contact me in the server!

Have fun bragging to your friends
