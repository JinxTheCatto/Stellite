## What is Stellite?
Stellite is the world's first Fortnite Festival autoplayer, with high customizability and a useful featureset.

You can [see an early version in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ho50fxCqPs)

## Limitations
- Stellite plays best on the drums
- Stellite supports most standard resolutions, but higher resolutions than 1440 require additional support due to the lack of match images. Contact me for further assistance or make your own according to the naming scheme in the assets folder

## Benefits
### Performance benefits:
- Stellite can play any song flawlessly on any difficulty, including expert.
- Stellite can achieve high rankings worldwide, depending on the presence of exploited scores for that song.
- Stellite is COMPLETELY UNDETECTABLE.

### Account benefits:
- Gain free Season Levels for the battle pass via the Try Fortnite Festival quest line.
- Earn Festival Points and claim free rewards through various quest lines.

## Usage
- Use Python 3.10.6
- Play Fortnite on windowed fullscreen, and preferably low quality rendering mode (this makes brightness match with what the match images use)
- Use the setup.bat script to install dependencies
- Run the start.bat script
- Restart the program after altering the config file, if needed
- Join the discord for the config values explanation

## IMPORTANT NOTES
Currently the only built in match images are for 1440p, 1080p, and 768p, if you have a different resolution you must either make your own images matching those in the assets folder with those that suite your game or contact me on the discord to do it for you, and help me add support to mose resolutions

To play songs flawlessly you will most likely have to fine-tune the configuration values to achieve optimal results based on your resolution, processing speed, and refresh rate, especially if your resolution is something other than 1080p. Use the debug window for assistance.
